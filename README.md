# Hand Gesture Recognition Model

## Overview

This project aims to develop a hand gesture recognition model capable of accurately identifying and classifying different hand gestures from image or video data. The model enables intuitive human-computer interaction and facilitates gesture-based control systems.

## Features

- Recognizes and classifies various hand gestures.
- Works with both image and video data.
- Provides seamless integration for human-computer interaction.
- Supports gesture-based control systems.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Machine learning libraries (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch)
- Image processing libraries (e.g., OpenCV)
- Additional dependencies specified in `requirements.txt`

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:



2. Install dependencies:



## Usage

1. Train the model:

```
python train.py
```

2. Test the model:

```
python test.py
```

3. Integrate with your application:

```python
import hand_gesture_recognition

# Use the model to recognize gestures in your application
```
